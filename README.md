# Chat-Room
The ChatRoom application is a C++ project that creates a simple chat room where multiple clients can connect to a server and message each other in real time. The server handles client connections, message broadcasting, and ensures thread safety. The client provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using GTK for sending and receiving messages.
